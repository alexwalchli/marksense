#MarkSense
AI-assisted programming through dynamically generated code snippets embedded in intellisense.

##Goals
- Try to double coding speed
- Make it easier to keep coding style consistent across a code base and multiple developers

##TODOs
- Create snippet suggestion tree based on form of code not exact content
- Create n-grams of snippet suggestions for searching against
- Snippet searching with n-grams
- Tokenize snippet variables from code
- Create a dumbed down end to end demo
- Create first extension
- Make the snippet suggestion tree generation algorithm more performant
