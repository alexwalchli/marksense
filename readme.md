#MarkSense
AI-assisted programming through dynamically generated code snippets embedded in intellisense.

Work in progress <a href="https://alexwalchli.github.io/marksense/demo">demo</a>. 

##Goals
- Try to double coding speed
- Make it easier to keep coding style consistent across a code base and multiple developers
- Generated code style should match the code base's style. Less time fixing lint errors after the fact.
